What happens next?</p><p>As a consolidated view of security threats, a SIEM can be of great value to almost any organisation. However, a lot of organisations don&#x2019;t get sufficient value from their SIEM, or it&#x2019;s just a way for them to tick a box on a compliance form. Don&#x2019;t you really want to get the most out of that expensive new tool?</p><p>Once deployed, a lot of organisations think the job is done, but this couldn&#x2019;t be further from the truth. The SIEM will require constant and ongoing maintenance and improvements to continue to provide value. Otherwise it risks falling into disrepair and might become an even larger task to fix than the original deployment. I have seen organisations where it is easier to install a new SIEM rather than fix up the old one!</p><h2 id="what-are-the-first-things-to-consider">What are the first things to consider?</h2><p><br>The first thing to consider is why the decision to use a SIEM has been made. Ensure that the business requirements are known and what goals the organisation wishes to achieve by embarking on the SIEM journey. Begin with the end in mind. Ensure that the goals of the project are aligned with the original business requirements.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/2-what-are-the-first-things-to-consider.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="SIEM &#x2013; How to go from concept to incident ready" loading="lazy" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/2-what-are-the-first-things-to-consider.jpg 600w, https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/2-what-are-the-first-things-to-consider.jpg 640w"></figure><p>Take some time to consider the best product for your needs. SIEM solutions come in many flavours. There are open source products, a multitude of vendors that offer SIEMs, or even home-grown options if you have the skills and desire in house to do this. Be careful with the home-grown option however due to increased time to value.</p><p>Review the various hosting options for your selected SIEM. Do you want to host the SIEM in-house, or does your organisation have a cloud first strategy, in which it is a requirement to use a fully hosted option?</p><p>If you have settled on a SIEM product that you will be purchasing from a vendor, review the licensing model in use, as a lot of work will go into ensuring that you have the right type, and number, of licenses for your organisation. Licensing can be complex and expensive, depending on the licensing model for the SIEM selected. Right sizing the license is important, but this can be expanded later on, providing there is budget remaining. You will need to consider your logging requirements at this stage as well since most licensing schemes work by number or size of logs being imported. I&#x2019;ll talk more about determining logging requirements later on.</p><p>Remember to consider also the ongoing support and maintenance costs, as the higher the license cost, the higher the annual renewal bill that comes with it.</p><p>Review the architecture options available for your implementation. If you are hosting the SIEM in house then this will be very important, as it can mean the difference between a poorly performing SIEM and an incident ready SIEM at the end of the day. This is easier if you have decided on a cloud implementation, as less thought needs to go into the SIEM itself and more into ensuring secure, reliable and timely data transmission to the SIEM. There are many decisions to be made here and most likely the vendor you have selected will be able to offer you the best advice for your specific needs.</p><h2 id="which-logs-do-i-need">Which logs do I need?</h2><p>Now that some of the decisions have already been made around the SIEM, its important to start thinking about what the logging requirements are. As any technology professional knows, there are a huge abundance of logs available in any organisation. Do you want all of them? I&#x2019;d suggest not, or at the very least take a prioritised approach to adding logs to your SIEM. Onboarding everything in one hit is just asking for trouble.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/3-what-logs-do-i-need.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="SIEM &#x2013; How to go from concept to incident ready" loading="lazy" width="640" height="500" srcset="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/3-what-logs-do-i-need.jpg 600w, https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/3-what-logs-do-i-need.jpg 640w"></figure><p>Firstly, decide on some use cases for your SIEM. Use cases can help to prioritise which logs are going to provide you with the most value. Start with thinking about some likely attack scenarios for your organisation, from both internal and external threat actors. Then try to determine how you would detect these events, and which logs are going to be able to help you the most.</p><p>The other approach which goes hand in hand with the above is to rate servers or applications by risk, i.e. figure out which assets would be of the most value to attackers and start by collecting logs for your most critical assets.</p><p>By now you will have a pretty good idea of the order in which you want to start importing logs. Some others to think about are:</p><p>&#x2022; Active Directory, Kerberos, LDAP<br>&#x2022; Identity management and authentication data<br>&#x2022; IDS/IPS, Web/Email filters, WAF, Anti-Virus, Anti-Malware<br>&#x2022; DNS, DHCP, switch, router, firewall<br>&#x2022; Database (be sure to configure auditing in the databases, as most are not enabled by default)<br>&#x2022; Network flow data<br>&#x2022; Cloud data<br>&#x2022; Physical building security logs (e.g. door access)<br>&#x2022; Vulnerability scanners<br>&#x2022; System or policy change data</p><h2 id="other-things-to-think-about-before-installation"><br>Other things to think about before installation</h2><p>Make sure you consider who is going to have access to your brand new SIEM. Once the SIEM is running you might find a lot of people within the organisation want access. You need to decide up front what makes sense, and what doesn&#x2019;t. For example, operations teams might want to investigate locked accounts using the SIEM, especially if they don&#x2019;t have their own logging solution in place for authentication logs.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/4-other-things-to-think-about-before-installation.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="SIEM &#x2013; How to go from concept to incident ready" loading="lazy" width="639" height="426" srcset="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/4-other-things-to-think-about-before-installation.jpg 600w, https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/4-other-things-to-think-about-before-installation.jpg 639w"></figure><p>Ensure you have a plan for the permissions scheme you want to use. If you are going to have various teams other than the Security Team accessing your SIEM, you will want to have the appropriate permissions structure in place as to not allow access to data by team that don&#x2019;t need it. You may not want your Operations team having access to the web browsing data for the entire organisation for example.</p><p>Also think about who is going to be responsible for the ongoing maintenance of the SIEM. Are the security staff who the primary users of the SIEM, also the ones that are going to be required to maintain it, and log support calls to the vendor when something goes wrong? Document these support requirements up-front so that when something goes wrong, you don&#x2019;t have to start conversations about who is going to get it resolved.</p><p>This is also the time when you want to start thinking about which sources of threat intelligence are going to bring you the most value. There are plenty of free ones out there, and many paid ones exist as well. Something industry specific, if it is available, will likely bring you the most value. Do a web search for &#x201C;threat intelligence feeds&#x201D; if you aren&#x2019;t sure where to start. But beware, some threat intel feeds will fire more alerts than you know what to do with, so significant tuning may be required.</p><h2 id="purchasing-and-installation">Purchasing and Installation</h2><p><br>At this stage (or possibly even slightly earlier), you can start the procurement process for the required hardware, software and licenses. Make sure you contact multiple vendors to ensure you are getting the best deal on the SIEM that you want.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/5-purchasing-and-installation.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="SIEM &#x2013; How to go from concept to incident ready" loading="lazy" width="638" height="494" srcset="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/5-purchasing-and-installation.jpg 600w, https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/5-purchasing-and-installation.jpg 638w"></figure><p>OK, its crunch time. The hosting model is decided, maybe hardware has been purchased, software is ready to go, and licensing is all sorted. Time to get the thing up and running! Set up the hardware and software, or don&#x2019;t if you have selected a cloud model. The point is to make sure the SIEM is ready to start accepting logs.</p><p>Now you can start working through your prioritised log source lists and start adding them one by one, or in batches if your workflow allows for this. Make sure you watch the performance of your SIEM during this time, as this is where architecture and planning issues can start to show themselves.</p><h2 id="the-never-ending-cycle-of-siem">The Never-Ending Cycle of SIEM</h2><p><br>Now comes the fun part, the operationalisation of continuous SIEM improvement. The following steps are not things that need to be done just once, as much as you might wish it were that way. For a SIEM to be truly effective there needs to be an ongoing cycle of evaluation and refinement.</p><p>Continuously evaluate required log sources. Log sources change all the time. New systems are added, old systems are decommissioned, log sizes grow and diminish, and sometimes just stop working altogether. Ensure that you are on the lookout for any of these events, so that the SIEM has the right log sources needed to achieve your goals.</p><p>Evaluate threat intelligence. Are you getting value from your threat intel sources? Are there some new sources of threat intel that may potentially be useful? The other thing to consider here is if you are able to contribute your own threat intelligence to help others, although this does require a certain level of maturity within your operations that you won&#x2019;t have straight away.</p><p>Review your use cases on a regular basis. Are there some new ones based on new products the organisation is offering, or is the evolving threat landscape showing up new and different types of threats than in the past. Keeping on top of new use cases will help your SIEM continue to perform and meet business objectives.</p><p>Now for one of the most important tasks, without which, your SIEM will be much more difficult and onerous to operate. Write, evaluate, and tune the rules. A lot (if not all) of SIEMs come with out of the box rules you can use, which may or may not be suitable for your organisation. Apply the use cases that you have generated to ensure you have rules for each and every one of them.</p><p>This next task goes hand in hand with writing rules. Watch for and tune false positives constantly. If there has been an alert generated, and it is proven to be a false positive, then that rule should be tuned, so that you&#x2019;re not spending time on the same false positives more than once.</p><p>Performance monitoring and ensuring SIEM is performing up to scratch. In order to maintain your SIEM in a good state of health, it is important to perform preventative maintenance checks on a regular basis. As above, display metrics regarding the health of your SIEM on a dashboard. Ensure that the team who is responsible for the maintenance of the SIEM can see these dashboards, and receive the required alerts to provide a quick response when something goes wrong.</p><p>Develop meaningful dashboards. Dashboards are of critical importance to any well-functioning SIEM. They can display near real time status of the operational health of the SIEM, as well as important information about the security posture and compliance level of the organisation.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/6-dashboards.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="SIEM &#x2013; How to go from concept to incident ready" loading="lazy" width="639" height="425" srcset="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/08/6-dashboards.jpg 600w, https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/6-dashboards.jpg 639w"></figure><p>Try and automate as much as possible. If you are performing a task manually every time a specific alert comes in, can that task be automated or scripted in some way to reduce the workload on your analysts?</p><p>Now it&#x2019;s time to perform a review. Have you met your original goals and aligned with the business requirements?</p><p>Using the above continuous improvement cycle will allow your SIEM to be ready when the inevitable security incident arrives. Your SIEM will allow your incident response process to operate efficiently and effectively when the time comes. Ensure that your incident response processes are reflected in your SIEM processes and vice versa, and review these on a regular basis as well.</p><h2 id="ready-for-a-security-incident">Ready for a Security Incident?</h2><p><br>There is a lot to think about during the implementation of a SIEM, and many mistakes that can be made along the way. Hopefully this article has given you something to think about when it comes to your next SIEM implementation.</p><p>Is there anything that you think I have missed? Let me know in the comments. Good luck with your SIEM implementation!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Growing a new website...]]></title><description><![CDATA[Adrenalan's new website is now live... watch it grow as new content comes online.]]></description><link>https://www.adrenalan.com/a-new-website/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">62f5c199c24dae03ce3b0c86</guid><category><![CDATA[Services]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Simon Stahn]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 27 Aug 2018 10:48:42 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/daniel-hjalmarsson-269425-unsplash-1.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://www.adrenalan.com/content/images/2022/08/daniel-hjalmarsson-269425-unsplash-1.jpg" alt="Growing a new website..."><p>Welcome to the new Adrenalan website.

And by &#x2018;Answer&#x2019; (big &#x2018;A&#x2019;) I mean that the Consultants already have a pre-packaged, templated and ready-to-go piece of work that the Client will receive. <strong><strong>The Answer is almost a product in its own right</strong></strong> &#x2013; it may even have a product code in the Consultancy&#x2019;s billing/profit-tracking system!</p><p>The Client will not necessarily know that they&#x2019;re getting a pre-everythinged Answer &#x2013; they may even have been told that everything &#x201C;is bespoke&#x201D; or &#x201C;custom made for you&#x201D; and it will still take time and lots of money to deliver (because it &#x201C;tailor made&#x201D;).</p><p>Essentially, the thought process of a pre-canned Answer coming from a Consultancy is like the following sketch... plus or minus a little &#x2018;sprinkle&#x2019; of customisation (or copying/combining from other Answers).</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGUM1NnNZ02BA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0?e=1540425600&amp;v=beta&amp;t=fK2MtQLVrqsT6DeM05f9kA-fVJCIR7YkQcyATkTQv6k" class="kg-image" alt="The Problem is already knowing the Answer" loading="lazy"></figure><blockquote><em>...tell-tale signs... the most senior Consultant only talking to the most senior Client Stakeholders...</em></blockquote><p>Some <strong><strong>tell-tale signs</strong></strong> of a pre-canned Answer are when the delivery follows a delivery pattern similar to the following:</p><ul><li>The <strong><strong>most senior Consultant</strong></strong> (often Partner/Director level) initially spends maybe 60-80% of their available time onsite, usually <strong><strong>only talking to the most senior Client stakeholders</strong></strong> available (C-level or reporting directly to C-level). This often shows that the Consultant is most interested in relationship building and not discovering the actual problem or the Client&#x2019;s needs. Soon this senior Consultant begins to match their visits with the senior stakeholder&#x2019;s schedule and is rarely seen otherwise.</li><li>A <strong><strong>team of &#x2018;senior juniors&#x2019; shows up</strong></strong> (aka the &#x2018;worker bees&#x2019;), dealing with the daily work cycle. As the delivery carries on (assuming it takes more than a few weeks) the level of seniority of worker-bees drops and there is a noticeable <strong><strong>increase of &#x2018;on-the-job training&#x2019; of newer junior worker-bees</strong></strong>.</li><li>Some of the more <strong><strong>senior worker bees</strong></strong> have made good relationships with their Client-side peers and will be <strong><strong>actively taking over duties from</strong></strong> <strong><strong>the most senior Consultant</strong> </strong>wherever possible.</li><li>The most senior Consultant will be &#x2018;visible&#x2019; only to their Client stakeholders; only appearing otherwise if there are delivery issues.</li></ul><p>Note that nothing in the above list indicates the Client will not receive what they signed up for &#x2013; they will most probably receive exactly that! - but is it what they actually need?</p><blockquote><em>...the Consultancy will have templated output that simply needs input...</em></blockquote><p>Unless the Client is a &#x2018;first&#x2019; for a particular job style (which means you&#x2019;re on the bleeding edge of whatever you&#x2019;re trying to do &#x2013; a different topic for discussion), the <strong><strong>Client has signed up to receive a copy</strong></strong> of something the Consultancy has previously delivered (and they&#x2019;re now making &#x201C;money for old rope&#x201D;). Typically, the Consultancy will <strong><strong>have templated output that simply needs input</strong></strong> gathered from the Client and massaged into the right format to fit the output template.</p><p>Hence, the worker-bees (the junior staff) are tasked with gathering all the input and getting it massaged/sorted/aligned/etc for the templates. And there the Client get their Answer; the Answer the leading Consultant imagined when they first listened the Client recount their problem...</p><blockquote><em>My biggest issue... without rigour of process... no scientific method was used</em></blockquote><p>So, <strong><strong>what&#x2019;s the issue with this?</strong></strong> Let&#x2019;s go with a little list:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Unless the Client&#x2019;s problem is exactly what the Consultant thought they heard in the initial conversation</strong></strong>, the Client is getting something that is not fully aligned with their problem. It might be close&#x2026; and then again it might only <em><em>look</em></em> close.</li><li>The <strong><strong>Client is paying for</strong></strong> what they may believe is a &#x2018;custom&#x2019; solution to their problem. What they&#x2019;re actually getting is <strong><strong>a complex</strong></strong> <strong><strong>copy and paste</strong></strong>. There are a bunch of junior Consultancy staff collecting what they honestly believe to be the correct data, for a templated solution they were not part of generating.</li><li>But my biggest issue with this is that <strong><strong>usually a single person has made up their mind on what the problem is</strong></strong> (sometimes even before talking to them) <strong><strong>without any rigour of process</strong></strong>; i.e. <strong><strong>no scientific method was used</strong></strong>, or even abused, in the making of the Client&#x2019;s Answer!</li></ul><p>To be clear:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Not every Consultancy does this</strong></strong>; I have seen and worked with some great Consultants who will see an answer up front but will strive hard to ensure it is the right one for the Client. Bi-directional transparency between Consultancy and Client can help alleviate this issue.</li><li>Onsite/<strong><strong>on-the-job training is a good thing</strong></strong>, when it doesn&#x2019;t detract from the outcome for the client.</li><li><strong><strong>Templates, blueprints and frameworks - when used correctly</strong></strong> (i.e. for modular components of the complete final answer or when developing internal-use blueprints for a client&#x2019;s deployment) <strong><strong>are a good thing</strong></strong>. However, when used in what is often termed &#x2018;cookie cutter style&#x2019; on multiple client accounts is, at best, providing the client with a thin veneer of customisation on top of a commoditised solution.</li><li>At the highest level, <strong><strong>the answer to the Client&#x2019;s problem should always directly match the their needs</strong></strong> <strong><strong>and be traceable</strong></strong> to those needs. At a lower level, templates / blueprints / frameworks are all good at maintaining a level of quality for the solution delivery.</li></ul><p>As the client, how do you avoid being sold a pre-canned answer? And do you need to avoid it at all?</p><p>(Let&#x2019;s go with an IF &#x2026; THEN &#x2026; ELSE style for my answer.)</p><p><strong><strong>IF</strong></strong></p><ul><li>First, <strong><strong>is a pre-canned answer is acceptable to your needs?</strong></strong> At a technological level, this is what most cloud offerings deliver, after all &#x2013; Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) is a key point procurement departments everywhere are looking for (for the right or wrong reasons is a different discussion).</li></ul><p>THEN</p><ul><li>If you&#x2019;re happy that <strong><strong>your combined people, process and technology needs can be met</strong> </strong>with a <strong><strong>minimally customised commodity Answer</strong></strong> then go for it &#x2013; just be fully aware of what you&#x2019;re asking for and any short and longer term pitfalls.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>ELSE</strong></strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Be a little suspicious</strong></strong> (but not paranoid) if the initial discussion results in <strong><strong>too quick of an &#x2018;answer&#x2019;</strong></strong>; this could indicate the Consultancy is using a pre-canned response.</li><li><strong><strong>Ask about method</strong></strong>, about the <strong><strong>process</strong></strong> the Consultancy will use to arrive at your answer; know how your actual answer will be determined.</li><li>Have a <strong><strong>procurement method that allows for some flexibility</strong></strong> between phases and milestones. For example, the classic planning-discovery-analysis-delivery doesn&#x2019;t necessarily allow for re-planning pending the output of discovery; <strong><strong>a more agile approach</strong></strong>, with fixed constraints (time, budget, quality), can allow for the output to self-align without requiring a full &#x2018;go/no-go&#x2019; decision and a full project reset.</li></ul><p>END IF</p><blockquote><em>Consider using a Trusted Advisor to help define your problem and needs... choose someone who has nothing directly to gain from any solution</em></blockquote><p>Lastly, if you&#x2019;re a Client, <strong><strong>consider using a Trusted Advisor</strong></strong> <strong><strong>to</strong></strong> help <strong><strong>define your problem</strong> <strong>and</strong></strong>, more specifically, <strong><strong>your needs</strong></strong>.

What&#x2019;s your 3+1?"><p>I&#x2019;ve been around a lot of different projects, work sites and employer types&#x2026; and I&#x2019;ve spoken to even more people, at all levels of business, about <strong><strong>what they like, and do not like, in their working lives. </strong></strong>And it boils down to <strong><strong>three basic factors and one amplifying factor</strong></strong>.</p><p><strong><strong>Money</strong></strong>. This factor is a pretty easy one to explain &#x2013; how much you&#x2019;re paid for what you do. There is a threshold to this factor though &#x2013; the amount you need to survive, i.e. costs for food, clothing, shelter, health, education, etc. Below this threshold, increasing your income is your primary driving factor - not much else matters except survival. However, once you&#x2019;re happily above the threshold amount, deciding whether to move job is more about the other two factors than just money.</p><p><strong><strong>Interest</strong></strong>. What interests you? Are you a process person, enjoy running a business or system? Or are you a thinker &#x2013; good at finding and solving problems? Love reading and research? Everyone&#x2019;s interests are different and you need to know yours as they are important in how you successfully grow your career, as well as which interests enrich your non- or semi-work life.</p><p>So, the <strong><strong>initial two factors </strong></strong>above are pretty straight forward and <strong><strong>unique to each person</strong></strong>. Keep in mind that <strong><strong>both will wane over time</strong></strong> &#x2013; what is interesting to you now will be boring if you&#x2019;re doing it every day for the next year; and if you&#x2019;re paid the same money for the next five years it will no longer feel of the same value to you. Both <strong><strong>money and interest are positive factors</strong></strong>&#x2026; so what&#x2019;s the negative that balances this out?</p><p><strong><strong>Bullshit</strong></strong>. Each one of us has a measure of what we internally class as the &#x2018;BS&#x2019; of the job; it&#x2019;s the <strong><strong>negative influence</strong></strong>. It could be filling in those time-recording sheets on three different systems, all in triplicate; or it could be dodging the office politics. Everyone&#x2019;s BS factor is different &#x2013; and one person&#x2019;s BS may be another&#x2019;s interest!</p><p>How do these three factors fit together? Imagine that the money, interest and bullshit factors are represented by three pillars holding up a large plate, with a ball (representing your work-happiness) rolling around on top of the plate. If the three pillars are <strong><strong>balanced and even</strong></strong>, the ball can continue to roll around on the plate and <strong><strong>all is well</strong></strong>. If the factors are <strong><strong>skewed</strong></strong>, the ball will roll off the plate&#x2026; and <strong><strong>you&#x2019;re unhappy </strong></strong>at work and probably <strong><strong>looking for another job</strong></strong>.</p><p>There is one more factor (the &#x201C;<strong><strong>+1</strong></strong>&#x201D; in the title) that I need to mention - I call it the <strong><strong>GAS</strong></strong><strong><strong>factor</strong></strong>. It&#x2019;s your drive, your enthusiasm&#x2026; it&#x2019;s the &apos;gas&apos; you have in your tank, your fuel to get things done. Your GAS is comprised of all the little things that influence you on a daily basis. E.g. how <strong><strong>tired </strong></strong>you are, how your <strong><strong>kids </strong></strong>are behaving, are you <strong><strong>getting on well</strong></strong> with your partner, are you <strong><strong>eating well </strong></strong>and <strong><strong>feeling good </strong></strong>about yourself&#x2026; the list goes on.</p><p>Have you ever noticed that if you&#x2019;ve &#x2018;had enough&#x2019; of any one thing (maybe you&#x2019;re feeling really unfit and getting up in the mornings for the commute is a chore?) the money you&#x2019;re being paid doesn&#x2019;t feel as &#x2018;good&#x2019; as it did, or the really interesting thing you&#x2019;re working on has suddenly lost its shine&#x2026; this is <strong><strong>how the GAS factor influences </strong></strong>the other factors &#x2013; <strong><strong>it&#x2019;s an amplifier of the positive or the negative</strong></strong> depending on how you feel.</p><p>If you&#x2019;re low on GAS, the money and interest factors seem less and the bullshit seems smellier. But if you&#x2019;re rested, happy at home and all is good (your GAS is high)&#x2026; then the BS feels like less, the money is good-enough and the interesting stuff is satisfying.</p><p>It&#x2019;s not actually mathematical but you could visualise the 3+1 as follows:</p><blockquote><em><strong><strong>(Money + Interest - Bullshit) * GAS</strong></strong></em></blockquote><p>Isn&#x2019;t this a <strong><strong>bit of an over-simplification? Yes</strong></strong>, I guess it is. <strong><strong>But show me something that doesn&#x2019;t fit</strong></strong> into these factors and is a significant influence on you? I&#x2019;d be happy to hear it (honestly!) as all the people I&#x2019;ve discussed the 3+1 with over the years haven&#x2019;t been able to come up with anything that doesn&#x2019;t fit.</p><blockquote><em>What makes up your 3+1 ?</em></blockquote><p>Here&#x2019;s a <strong><strong>quick action plan for you</strong></strong>. Whether you&#x2019;re happy at work or not, start noting down<strong><strong><em><em>what makes up your 3+1</em></em></strong></strong><em><em>.</em></em> Consciousness about what makes up <em><em>your </em></em>factors will help you when the time comes to make the next choice. With your cool-headed knowledge of what makes you tick<strong><strong>, you can face the uncertainty of work changes with the certainty of knowing yourself</strong></strong> and what will suit you best.</p><blockquote><em>Employers: What are your employees&apos; 3+1?</em></blockquote><p>Finally, if you&#x2019;re an <strong><strong>employer the 3+1 is even more important </strong></strong>to understand. <strong><strong>What makes your employees&apos; 3+1?</strong></strong> If you&#x2019;re advertising for a vacancy in your organisation, don&#x2019;t just think about the skills needed but what it offers people. If a prospective employee evaluates a position you&#x2019;re offering, what do you want them to be motivated about? What will make them apply? What will you offer once the initial interest has become routine? (Tip: if it&#x2019;s just the money you think they&#x2019;ll go for, they&#x2019;ll leave once the money isn&#x2019;t their motivator anymore or if someone offers them a bit more money.)</p><p>The 3+1 may be a bit of an over-simplification of the complexities of the mix of working and life but <strong><strong>I hope my 3+1 helps clarify your thinking </strong></strong>a little and assists with <strong><strong>your next career decision</strong></strong>.</p><p>Some footnotes:</p><ul><li>&#x2018;Bullshit&#x2019; - I&#x2019;ve tried hard to find another word for this factor and have discussed it far and wide&#x2026; but &#x2018;bullshit&#x2019; still seems to describes it best! I&#x2019;m open to better suggestions.</li><li>GAS: You could also think of this as your Give-A-S*** factor. Same end result.</li><li>Originally, I had just the 3 factors. These factors kept things nice and simple, and everything &#x2018;work&#x2019; fit into the 3. This was until a few years ago, when I realised the importance and unconscious influence the rest of your life has on the working part of your life, which actually takes up most of your time. You can&#x2019;t separate work and &apos;the rest&apos;, despite all the &#x2018;work-life balance&#x2019; thoughts that seem to suggest there can be a clear separation. Your brain is a singular whole &#x2013; you can&#x2019;t ask it to simply switch on/off the work/home parts. Hence, the 3 factors became the 3+1.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
